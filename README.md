# Enron-Dataset
Analysis of the Enron Dataset to the Udacity Course - Data Science Foundations

The purpose of this project is to use financial and e-mail data from executives of the Enron company, which was released by the US government during the federal investigation, to arrive at a predictive model that could identify people involved in the fraud.
The files include financial and e-mail data of 146 people (records), classified as People of Interest (POI), most of whom are senior management, 14 financial resources, and 6 e-mail resources. Within these records, 18 were labeled as a "person of interest" (POI).
